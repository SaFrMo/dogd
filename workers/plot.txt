BRIEFING.

JULY 4, 2414.

The Grand Duchy is a derelict civilian luxury liner commissioned on April 27, 2353. It was a top-of-the-line ship and very popular in its day; it ran its fifty years without major incident and was decommissioned on July 4, 2403. 

With the war on, stripping-down of defunct ships was put on hold; the Grand Duchy was hastily stripped for any useful parts and left alone after that. Now that the war's over, we need to pick up our previous objective and safely dismantle and dispose of derelict ships like the Duchy.

You and your crew will systematically take the ship apart, document its contents, and recycle all parts involved. The more whole parts you return, the higher your pay will be.
